## Overview

Spotify control box which sits on top of any open windows and gives you play/pause/skip/back control over your music. When expanded, the window also gives you a search box which gives you full access to spotify searches. In addition, searching for "playlists" will give you a list of your playlists, and searching "Q", "q", "Queue", or "queue" gives you the current song queue not including the songs out of the base playlist.

Note: this requires spotify premium (see Install).
